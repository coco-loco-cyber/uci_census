#### Chi-Squared Testing Using the Census Income Data Set

#### Introduction
This project uses the Census Income data set from the Univeristy of California, Irvine's machine learning respository to show how Chi-Squared testing can be used to compare qualitative variables against each other to check how they may or may not significantly impact each other.

I show a few different ways of looking at the data set. I found that it is easy to get lost in rabbit holes if you do not properly scope your question. Also, you can arrive
at similiar conclusions for the data as a whole when looking at different variables or situations in the data set. Meaning, that just because you can conduct an analysis or
comparison; at what point are you drifting from value in analysis and wasting time or resources to arrive at the same conclusion? 

I am still new to data analysis and using python to do it. I am merely showcasing things I have worked on to document my journey. 

#### Methodology

1. Read the data and removed all quantitative variables.
2. Plotted various Histograms to visualize the data and begin to understand it more.
3. Wrote about initial observations. Data is not always clear, can be vague, or may be misleading. Important to note these.
4. Cleaned the data set and identified a question to make of the data set.
5. Created a function in Python to visualize the cleaned data set.
6. Used Histogram plots to visualize the data. I cleaned up the graphs to make them more visually appealing than previous plots.
7. My next steps involved filtering the data in various ways and calculating proportions to gain perspective of the data set.
8. My next step will involve conducting the actual Chi-Squared testing using Python.
9. Created frequency tables for data to be tested.
10. Created a function for Chi-Square testing on variables to obtain P-Value.
11. Test the significance of education on income for all races.
12. The question is: Does education significantly impact income? 
13. Chi-Square testing shows that the answer is, yes.
