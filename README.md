#### Chi-Squared Testing Using the Census Income Data Set

#### Introduction
This project uses the Census Income data set from the Univeristy of California, Irvine's machine learning respository to show how Chi-Squared testing can be used to compare qualitative variables against each other to check how they may or may not significantly impact each other.

I show a few different ways of looking at the data set. I found that it is easy to get lost in rabbit holes if you do not properly scope your question. Also, you can arrive
at similiar conclusions for the data as a whole when looking at different variables or situations in the data set. Meaning, that just because you can conduct an analysis or
comparison; at what point are you drifting from value in analysis and wasting time or resources to arrive at the same conclusion? 

I am still new to data analysis and using python to do it. I am merely showcasing things I have worked on to document my journey.
